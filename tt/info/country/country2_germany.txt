The Germans are often known as one of the major 
protagonists of World War II but their role in the 
previous "War to end all wars" is often misunderstood. 
The largest and most powerful of the Central Powers, Germany 
nearly succeeded in their invasion of France, but were 
stopped outside of the capital, Paris. The resulting stalemate 
lead to the "race to the sea" and began much of the trench 
warfare that characterized World War I.
