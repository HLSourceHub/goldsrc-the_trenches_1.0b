Cliff(Trench Capture)

By Sgt. Garvey

The acute scale of the austere seaside cliff has not discouraged 
the Great War from moving into its territory. The British and 
Germans have entrenched themselves on two small hills overlooking a 
small valley. The last week has shown little activity on either 
side, but reconnasaince flights indicate an increase in German activity...

Objectives:
- Engage and attack the enemy trench.
- Capture the enemy's trench with the help of allies.
