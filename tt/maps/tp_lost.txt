Lost(Push)

By the_Leprechaun


The Germans have sent troops through a narrow, mountainous 
passage as a followup to a successful trench capture. Local 
partisans have hastily constructed trenches for their British 
allies: if the Germans manage to capture the bridge, all hope is 
lost. Can the Germans make the most of their successful offensive 
or will they be beaten back by the British reinforcements?
