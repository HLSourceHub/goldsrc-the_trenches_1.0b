Attack(Trench Capture)

By the_Leprechaun

An early autumn morning on the Western Front. An eery mist covers the 
battlefield and both armies are anxious. The battlefield has fluctuated 
in territory since the beginning of spring and soon the European winter 
will prevent further operations. Both German and British commanders want 
control of the central trench line before winter sets in.
