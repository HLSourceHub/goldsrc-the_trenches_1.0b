Trapped(Trench Capture)

By the_Leprechaun


Heavy shelling from artillery on either side has created d
eep craters in no man's land, obliterating any natural obstacle 
to bullets. Those who venture into no man's land risk life and limb 
for an advance on the enemy, and the downhill slope is perfect for 
grenades. The pockmarked earth may be a gift from the heavens or a 
curse, as grenades roll conveniently down the slope that leads into 
no man's land.
