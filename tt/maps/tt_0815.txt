0815(Trench Capture)

By Hawk (sesselschoner@web.de)


A small slice of Western Front combat. The remnants 
of a once pristine village lies in the center of no man's land; 
most of the village has been decimated to their foundations. 
Two large hills help to shelter the main trench lines, which are 
very long and elaborate. Sandbag bunkers and observation posts 
may be worth keeping a guard in to observe enemy movement. 
Can you rally your forces to capture the enemy's trench? 
Be careful, as an attack may prompt a strong response 
by nearby reinforcements
