Zorn (Push)

By Morphew ( ich@morphew.de )

A quaint town about fifty miles from the coastline,
the small, unnamed French village of Zorn has little
tactical importance. The town is primarily used by
the Allies, which control the port, as an area of
resupply.
Battle wearied troops are also diverted here to engage
in more menial tasks until they are ready to return to
combat. The Germans have occupied the railway that
used to run through the village, and have camped about
twenty miles away from the area. The night before
fighting began, the Germans dispatched around 120 troops
to raid the Allied area and to disrupt supplies.
The British themselves lacked a secure position as,
two nights previous, much of their force was diverted
to reinforce the Salient. After a light artillery
bombardment, both the Allies and Germans have set up
impromptu trenches and much of the town's population
remains locked indoors or has evacuated.

Objectives:

Allied forces: 
You have to fight the evil central powers
back to hell and take control of the 5 flags.

Central Powers:
When you control all five flags you control
the whole area. This achieves the best
strategic position in our war. Go for victory!
